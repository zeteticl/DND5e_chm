<P>It's possible for the characters to start a campaign at 
1st level, dive into an epic story, and reach 10th level and beyond in a short 
amount of game time. Although that pace works fine for many campaigns, some DMs 
prefer a campaign story with pauses built into it��times when adventurers are not 
going on adventures. The downtime rules given in this section can be used as 
alternatives to the approach in the Player's Handbook and the Dungeon Master's 
Guide, or you can use the material here to inspire the creation of your own 
options.</P>
<P>By engaging the characters in downtime activities that 
take weeks or even months to complete, you can give your campaign a longer time 
line��one in which events in the world play out over years. Wars begin and end, 
tyrants come and go, and royal lines rise and fall over the course of the story 
that you and the characters tell.</P>
<P>Downtime rules also provide ways for characters to 
spend��or be relieved of��the monetary treasure they amass on their 
adventures.</P>
<P>The system presented here consists of two elements. 
First, it introduces the concept of rivals. Second, it details a number of 
downtime activities that characters can undertake.</P></body>
