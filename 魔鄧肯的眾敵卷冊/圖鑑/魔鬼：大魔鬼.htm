<P>At the top of the hierarchy of the Nine Hells stand 
thearchdevils, a vicious and backbiting group made up ofthe Hel1s' elite devils. 
They include the various lords,the nobles who owe them fealty, and some exiles 
andoutcasts who have fallen out of favor. Favor in the NineHells shifts like the 
wind, and the fortunes of the greatand mighty rise and fall at the whims of 
their betters.Many dread names are included in the rolls of the archdevils; the 
few described here are among those thatadventurers are most 1ikely to 
encounter.<BR><STRONG>Wish Fulfillment.</STRONG> All devils seek control ovcr 
mortalsouls, so they offer enticements to tempt mortals intomaking unwise 
bargains. Archdevils, possessing thetrue power of the Nine Hells, can fulfill 
nearly any desire (within the limits of a wish spell) requested by themortals 
they bind to their infernal contracts. Archdevilsalways fulfill the letter of 
the wish, rewarding desperatemortals with a twisted interpretation of their 
desires.In exchange for this gift, the devil expects and receivestotal power 
over a soul and usually claims it upon themortal's death.An archdevil can't 
fulfill its own wish.</P></body>
