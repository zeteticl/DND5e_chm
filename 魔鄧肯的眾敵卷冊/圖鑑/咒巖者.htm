cursed</STRONG>  </FONT></P>
<P>（背景文字翻譯暫缺）<BR>The stone cursed are spawned through a foul 
alchemical ritual performed on a humanoid that has been turned to stone. The 
ritual, which requires a mixture of basilisk blood and the ashes from the burned 
feathers of a cockatrice, awakens a dim echo of the petrified victim's spirit, 
animating the statue and turning it into a useful guardian.<BR><STRONG>Lingering 
Spirits.</STRONG> The stone cursed possess a malevolent drive to slay the 
living, yet they are utterly loyal to whoever performed the ritual to animate 
them, and they obey that being's orders to the best of their ability. In combat, 
stony claws that drip with thick, gray sludge emerge from a stone cursed's 
fingers. This alchemical sludge transforms those slashed by the claws into 
statues.<BR><STRONG>A Strange Harvest.</STRONG> As part of the ritual used to 
create a stone cursed, a fist-sized obsidian skull forms within the creature's 
torso. The skull isn't visible while the stone cursed is active, but when it is 
slain, the statue shatters and the skull clatters to the ground. Because it is 
the nexus for the alchemy used to create these horrors, a dim echo of the 
original victim's memories resonates within the skull. A skilled magic-wielder 
can attempt to extract memories from it to gain insight into the victim's past 
or find lore that otherwise would be lost.<BR><STRONG>Constructed 
Nature.</STRONG> A stone cursed doesn't require air, food, drink, or 
sleep.<BR><STRONG>Cryptic Whispers.</STRONG> Even though creatures transformed 
into stone cursed are long dead, a vague whisper of their memories lives on in 
the obsidian skull embedded within the stone cursed's body. At the end of a 
short rest, a character can make a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check to attempt 
to extract a memory from the skull—a memory that is a response to a verbal 
question posed by the character to the skull. Once this check is made, whether 
it succeeds or fails, the skull can't be used in this manner again.</P>
